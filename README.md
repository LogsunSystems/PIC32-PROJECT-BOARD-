# PIC32-PROJECT-BOARD-
   PIC32-HMZ144 
## INTRODUCTION:
 PIC32-HMZ144 board features a PIC32MZ2048EFG144 processor. It is one of the most-capable PIC32 processors ever made and it has a lot of interfaces available (FPU, 6 x UARTs; 6 x SPIs; 5 x I2Cs; 120 x IO pins; 48-channel ADC; two analog comparators; Ethernet; USB-OTG; JTAG; TRACE; etc.) The board has several ready-to-use interfaces exposed and available on connectors: a micro SD card connector; mini USB connector (with OTG functionality); ICSP connector for programming and debugging; UEXT connector for extension modules; user programmable LED; user-programmable button; 100 pinholes in two rows for measurements and access to IO processor pins; etc.
