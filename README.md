# PIC32-PROJECT-BOARD-
   PIC32-HMZ144 
## INTRODUCTION:
 PIC32-HMZ144 board features a PIC32MZ2048EFG144 processor. It is one of the most-capable PIC32 processors ever made and it has a lot of interfaces available (FPU, 6 x UARTs; 6 x SPIs; 5 x I2Cs; 120 x IO pins; 48-channel ADC; two analog comparators; Ethernet; USB-OTG; JTAG; TRACE; etc.) The board has several ready-to-use interfaces exposed and available on connectors: a micro SD card connector; mini USB connector (with OTG functionality); ICSP connector for programming and debugging; UEXT connector for extension modules; user programmable LED; user-programmable button; 100 pinholes in two rows for measurements and access to IO processor pins; etc.     
 ## FEATURES:
The most notable board features are listed below:
* PIC32MZ2048EFG144 with 512KB RAM and 2MB flash (PIC32MZ2048ECG144 was used before)
* USB-OTG functionality with mini USB connector
* Micro SD card connector
* ICSP for debugging and programming
* JTAG pins exposed on 0.1" step 6 pins
* EXT1 and EXT2 50 pin 0.1" connectors that ease the access to the processor
* RESET and USER buttons
* PWR and STATUS LEDs
* Li-Po battery connector and charger
* UEXT connector
* Dimensions: (77×52)mm ~ (3×2)mm 
## HARDWARE REQUIRED FOR PROGRAMMING
           In order upload code on the board you would need a PIC32 compatible debugger or programmer. Older tools might lack support for PIC32 processor. Please ensure your programmer/debugger is compatible with the PIC32MZ processor family.
## SOFTWARE REQUIRED FOR PROGRAMMING
          You would need software that supports PIC32MZ family of processors. The most commonly used tool for software development for PIC32MZ applications is MPLAB X. The most used tool for binary upload to PIC32MZ is MPLAB IPE. Microchip provides a set of libraries and demo projects for the PIC32MZ family in their “Harmony Integrated Software Framework”.

**NOTE:  THAT MPLAB 8.XX DOES NOT SUPPORT PIC32MZ.**
